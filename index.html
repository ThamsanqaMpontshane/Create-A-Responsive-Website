              Cape Town is one of the most beautiful city in South Africa . It
              comprises of Table Mountain and Robben Island which are the most
              visited tourist attractions in Cape Town . Although Cape Town is
              my Home town the are some places I haven't visited before like
              Robben Island and Cape Town Diamond Meuseum which I hope to visit
              by this year . Not only is Cape Town a tourist hub it is also a
              business hub that provides employment to thousands of MOTHER CITY
              residents.

          The language I adore and would love to learn the most is Irish which
          is a language that originates from Ireland in Europe . The first time
          I heard Irish was when I was listening to Drill Music , from there the
          rest is history .

            <p>
              The Castle of Good Hope known locally as the Castle or Cape Town
              Castle is a bastion fort built in the 17th century in Cape Town,
              South Africa. Originally located on the coastline of Table Bay,
              following land reclamation the fort is now located inland. In 1936
              the Castle was declared a historical monument (now a provincial
              heritage site) and following restorations in the 1980s it is
              considered the best preserved example of a Dutch East India
              Company fort.
