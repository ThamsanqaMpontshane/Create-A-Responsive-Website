              New York is one of the most beautiful city in the United States Of
              America .It is the most populated city in the country. It
              comprises of Central Park and Statue of Liberty which are the most
              visited tourist attractions in New York . The Place I would like
              to visit the most is the Time Square because it comprises of many
              entertainment centers . Not only is New York a tourist hub it is
              also a business hub that provides employment to thousands of
              United States Of America residents.

            <p>
              The Castle of Good Hope known locally as the Castle or Cape Town
              Castle is a bastion fort built in the 17th century in Cape Town,
              South Africa. Originally located on the coastline of Table Bay,
              following land reclamation the fort is now located inland. In 1936
              the Castle was declared a historical monument (now a provincial
              heritage site) and following restorations in the 1980s it is
              considered the best preserved example of a Dutch East India
              Company fort.
